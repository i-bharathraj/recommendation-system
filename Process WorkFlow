Step 1: Data Acquisition and Setting up
1.1 Collecting images and colour information.
Dataset Sources: Finding the data sources from the internet, and using my own photos of rooms, or use publicly available datasets.
Colour Information: Each image will be tagged with the room's existing colour and light sources. This can be done manually or with a colour extraction tool.
